# Superblock Placement Optimization in Barcelona

With the goal of creating a healthier city environment through the increase in public use space and reduction in air pollution while minimizing impact to commuters, we seek to identify an optimal location to incorporate a Superblock within the city of Barcelona. By determining the Nash equilibrium and social equilibrium of traffic flow on Barcelona as a result of incorporating one Superblock at a time, we analyze best placement options tied to overall travel time, travel cost and Price of Anarchy.
